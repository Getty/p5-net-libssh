# Old firmware offers only algorithms libssh no longer proposes by default:

# options kex, hostkeys, ciphers_c_s, ciphers_s_c, hmac_c_s and hmac_s_c let
# a caller opt in to them explicitly; left alone, nothing changes.
#
# Each case starts a fake server (t/lib/fake-sshd.c) that offers exactly one
# legacy algorithm, then connects twice: without the option, which must fail
# with libssh's "no match" and must not croak, and with it, which must work.
# The fake server is built from the same libssh the module links, so a libssh
# built without an algorithm makes the server refuse to start, and this file
# fails instead of silently testing less.
